            "LLM stands for Large Language Model. It refers to a type of artificial intelligence (AI) designed to process and understand human language at a large scale. LLMs are trained on vast amounts of text data, which enables them to learn patterns, relationships, and structures of language.\n",

            "2. **Language understanding**: LLMs can comprehend and generate human-like text, including grammar, syntax, and semantics.\n",
            "3. **Generative capabilities**: LLMs can create new text based on a given prompt, topic, or style.\n",
            "4. **Contextual understanding**: LLMs can capture nuances of language, such as idioms, colloquialisms, and figurative language.\n",

            "\n",
            "1. **Chatbots and virtual assistants**: LLMs power conversational interfaces, like chatbots and voice assistants.\n",
            "2. **Language translation**: LLMs can translate text from one language to another.\n",
            "3. **Text summarization**: LLMs can summarize long documents or articles into concise, meaningful summaries.\n",
            "4. **Content generation**: LLMs can create content, such as articles, blog posts, or even entire books.\n",
            "5. **Sentiment analysis**: LLMs can analyze text to determine the sentiment or emotional tone behind it.\n",
            "\n",
            "Examples of LLMs include:\n",
            "\n",
            "1. **Transformer models**: BERT, RoBERTa, and other transformer-based models.\n",
            "2. **Recurrent neural networks (RNNs)**: LSTMs, GRUs, and other RNN-based models.\n",
            "3. **Generative models**: GPT, T5, and other generative models.\n",
